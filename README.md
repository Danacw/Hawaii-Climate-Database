# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
UC Davis Spring 2021 | Unit 10 SQLAlchemy Challenge | Surfs Up Climate Analysis

For this challenge, I used ORM queries, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib and a Flask API to analyze climate data in Honolulu Hawaii. Through my analysis, I can conclude that the months with the most amount of precipitation in this dataset occured in August 2016 and April 2017.
