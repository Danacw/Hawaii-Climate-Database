# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
UC Davis Spring 2021 | Unit 10 SQLAlchemy Challenge | Surfs Up Climate Analysis

For this challenge, I used ORM queries, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib and a Flask API to analyze climate data in Honolulu Hawaii. Through my analysis, I can conclude that the months with the most amount of precipitation in this dataset occured in August 2016 and April 2017. I was also able to find the lowest temperature of 54 degrees farenheit occured on January 16th, 2013, and the highest temperature of 85 degrees farenheit occured on September 10th, 2015, while the average temperature for all dates was 71.66 degrees farenheit. Based on my t-test results I found that there is typically a significant difference of 3.9 degrees farenheit between warmer temperatures in June and slightly colder temperatures in December.
